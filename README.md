# Lagrange-s-Theorem
Lagrange theorem is one of the central theorems of abstract algebra. It states that in group theory, for any finite group say G, the order of subgroup H of group G divides the order of G. The order of the group represents the number of elements. This theorem was given by Joseph-Louis Lagrange.
